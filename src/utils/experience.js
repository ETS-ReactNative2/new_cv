        description: `BNP Paribas is one of famous bank here in France. At ITG, the IT section in BNP Paribas, the project is the development of a web application which allow user to use an intern software named ADRET.  
In short term, the ADRET software takes in input **data from either a file (xml, txt, ...) either database (mysql, oracle, postgresql)** and _anonymise_ them in output. The purpose is to not know data we manipulate because bank take it <u>from their real data client</u>.  
We're building the web application with <span>Angular 6</span>. In this internship, I observe how a big company manage a huge project with a direct impact to its clients. I learn a lot from the team. We dicuss every time we want to make a significative change and my voice matters. I also discover some new way of coding, or thinking if I can say that. We're not only code frontend side. In the backend, we use <span>Java Spring 8</span>. I'm still in my internship and the project still running.`

        description: `This one is a list of a few personal projects I have done.  
In most case I use React but sometimes I decide to use vanilla. The thing is when I have time on my hand, I code. I have enjoyed working on these projects throughout my learning process. Here below are some of the ones you can check (_click on title to view demo_):  
* [**My first interactive resume in React**](https://cv-believe-lody.herokuapp.com/) : Once I knew react basics, I challenged myself to make a resume with web languages. The main idea was to have 4 panels which each displays specific information. For one with too much information, a click expands it to take the whole container width and height containing the 4 panels. Another click makes it go back to normal.
* [**Portfolio**](https://djonamanimona.netlify.com) : I wanted to make a portfolio but not about web development. I have a friend who is photographer and I asked him if I could use some of his photos and build a website with them. This one is also made with react. I used <span>materialize</span> for styling.
* [**JS workout**](https://js-work.herokuapp.com/index.php) : In this one, I made a series of mini-projects where I trained myself in html, css and vanilla. Please feel free to have a look.
* [**Audio Player**](https://codepen.io/believelody/pen/GbJajX) : I already managed to make a real web player with React. But I wanted to do that solely using vanilla. In my codepen account, you will find how I simulate a player. Try to play with it. Choose a track, pause the song, press shuffle or repeat button, expand it, have fun!!!`

        description: `**ConnectedBee** is the last project we made this year. In PIC, which acronym stands for <u>Innovative and Creativity Project</u>, we digged into IoT world.  
The goal was to make a beehive connected to an application which display different data such as weight and indoor/outdoor temperature.  
For this one, we used Raspberry pi and managed to link it with a web application made in Angular, and all of that over <span>GSM transmission</span>. The GSM shield's running program was coded in python and we used a Free chip (mobile operator) to ensure communication between those two entities.  
I was in charge of building the frontend part but also the backend of the web application which will display data from raspberry pi:
* Frontend:
  * Angular;
  * Chart.js.
* Backend:
  * NodeJS;
  * MongoDB via mlab.

<u>Note</u>: _In login page, type test@test.com as email and test as password. And then, choose the beehive 1 and watch data recorded between January 27th and March_.`

        description: `ITM is a french acronym for **Mobile Device Interaction**.  
In this project, we had to apply knowledge learnt during the courses about mobile programming. The goal is to develop a web application which enables communication between two or many devices. To properly carry this out, the project has been split into 3 main parts:
  * Indoor geolocalisation;
  * Caretaking localisation;
  * Employees management plateform. 

As a team, my role was to build the employees management plateform. I managed to do this with _React JS_ for client side and _Firebase_ as **<span>BaaS</span>**.  
The other parts have been made with Android Studio and different captors such as <span>NFC</span> or <span>Bluetooth</span>.`

        date: '09/2018 - 11/2018',
        description: `When I started learning React, a local dj contacted me. His activity began to increase and he wanted to be visible on the web. What he wanted was a website where he could publish his events and testimonies from customers. As he likes mixing, I decided to add a player to the website.  
This was a great challenge to me because this was the first real project I made with react. I managed to make a player like spotify, where when you play music, the player appareas and if you navigate in another page, it stays displaying until you close it. I worked with <span>Redux</span>, <span>Semantic UI React</span> and <span>Contentful</span> which is an **awesome Headless CMS**. The project was currently hold and the website is hosted on <u>Netlify</u>.
